    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked BBQ wings are a tasty and easy-to-make dish. They are coated in a flavorful BBQ sauce and baked until crispy and tender, making them a perfect appetiser or main course for any gathering.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>32 frozen chicken wings (such as Costco), defrosted</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>¾ cup barbecue sauce, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil; lightly brush with 1 teaspoon oil.</li>
        <li>Place wings in a single layer on the prepared pan, skin-sides up, with a little space between each wing. Brush tops of wings with 1/3 cup oil. Brush hot sauce over oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with pan juices a few times, until wings are browned, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove wings from baking sheet; wipe baking sheet with paper towels. Return wings to baking sheet; spread barbecue sauce on tops of wings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 5 minutes. Spread barbecue sauce over wings; bake 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
